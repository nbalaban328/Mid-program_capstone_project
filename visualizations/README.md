# Phase 2 EDA Visualizations

This folder contains all static visualizations from the Phase 2 Exploratory Data Analysis notebook. These high-resolution PNG images are provided for easy viewing on GitHub and in presentations.

## Task 2.1: Utilization Pattern Analysis
1. **01_top_10_most_utilized.png** - Top 10 most utilized benefit subtypes
2. **02_bottom_10_least_utilized.png** - Bottom 10 least utilized benefit subtypes  
3. **03_monthly_usage_trends.png** - Monthly usage frequency trends (2023-2024)
4. **04_engagement_distribution.png** - Employee engagement distribution (pie chart)
5. **05_engagement_by_subtype.png** - Unique employees by engagement level and benefit subtype
6. **06_401k_utilization.png** - Utilization comparison across 401k subtypes
7. **07_treemap_usage_by_type.png** - Treemap showing usage by benefit type and subtype
8. **08_cost_vs_usage_scatter.png** - Cost vs usage scatter plot (subtype level)

## Task 2.2: Demographic Insights Discovery
9. **09_usage_by_gender_department.png** - Usage frequency heatmap by gender and department
10. **10_usage_by_age_department.png** - Usage frequency heatmap by age group and department
11. **11_department_preferences.png** - Top 5 subtype preferences per department
12. **12_usage_by_type_gender.png** - Usage by benefit type split by gender (stacked bar)
13. **13_usage_by_type_age.png** - Usage by benefit type split by age group (stacked bar)

## Task 2.3: Cost Efficiency and Subcategory Analysis
14. **14_quadrant_cost_vs_usage.png** - Quadrant plot: Cost vs Usage with median lines
15. **15_quadrant_cpu_vs_satisfaction.png** - Quadrant plot: Cost-per-usage vs Satisfaction
16. **16_roi_ranking_elimination_candidates.png** - ROI ranking with elimination candidates flagged

## Technical Details
- **Resolution**: High-resolution images (scale=2) for crisp display
- **Format**: PNG for universal compatibility
- **Dimensions**: Optimized for both web viewing and presentations
- **Source**: Generated from Phase_2_EDA.ipynb using Plotly and Kaleido

## Usage
These images can be:
- Embedded in presentations or reports
- Viewed directly on GitHub (unlike interactive Plotly charts)
- Used as reference when the notebook's interactive plots don't render
- Included in documentation or academic papers

For interactive versions, run the Phase_2_EDA.ipynb notebook locally.
