we need to see what potentially could change in our KPIs if we reallocate our budget
lets say I reallocate 401k spending
- how will ROI, cost per customer,  customer satisfaction, and benefit utilization change

for the actionable recs, what metrics are we looking at that will help us make recommendations

TANMAY use this for budget reallocation in dashboard

# Display current (before) KPIs table
current_kpis_display = current_kpis[['BenefitType','BenefitSubType','CurrentBudget','CurrentUtilization','CurrentSatisfaction']].copy()
print('Current (Before) KPIs:')
display(current_kpis_display.head(20))

# Display predicted (after) KPIs table
predicted_kpis_display = predicted_df[['BenefitType','BenefitSubType','BudgetAllocated','PredictedUtilization','PredictedSatisfaction','CostPerEmployee','PredictedROI']].copy()
print('Predicted (After) KPIs:')
display(predicted_kpis_display.head(20))



Slide 11: Key Findings

Slide 12: Cost vs Usage





Slide 13: Recommendations

High Priority

Slide 14: Portfoilio Rebalancing
  #include a visualization (maybe of current spend vs optimized spend)#
  Pitch: by analyzing usage data, we identified 566,516 tied up in underperforming benefits (include visual of where you got this number). Rebalancing the portfolio will mean we reallocate those funds to programs employees     actually use and value, addressing the concern of satisfaction and retention without increasing overall costs. TechLance's overall ROI of benefits would also show improvement.
  #provide example: oh if funds were focused here instead of here....#
  we can pilot reallocation in one direction and set up quarterly / yearly benefits usage reviews for continuous optimization

Slide 15: Personalization
  #include a visualization (of clustering groups) or example of a cluster and its data)
  Pitch: Another high priority recommendation is personalization. To push away the benefits being a one-size fits all program, we segment employees into key groups determined by factors like age, tenure, and department. This way we can tailor specific benefits recommendations and meet the employees' unique needs while maximizing usage. this will further drive higher satisfaction, retention, and smarter spending. #briefly explain / show how based on a cluster we would choose what benefit#?
