we need to see what potentially could change in our KPIs if we reallocate our budget
lets say I reallocate 401k spending
- how will ROI, cost per customer,  customer satisfaction, and benefit utilization change

for the actionable recs, what metrics are we looking at that will help us make recommendations

Slide 11: Key Findings

Slide 12: Cost vs Usage


Slide 17 – Portfolio Rebalancing (High Priority) (≈1.5 min)

*"Let’s start with our first high-priority recommendation: portfolio rebalancing.

Right now, nearly 40% of TechLance’s benefits budget is tied to programs that don’t deliver much return. Things like certain gym partnerships and advanced degree programs sound attractive, but they’re not being used in ways that justify their cost.

Meanwhile, benefits like monthly communications and individual healthcare plans — which employees clearly value — are underfunded. By shifting resources toward these higher-performing programs, we could unlock more than half a million dollars in value.

The key point here is: we don’t need to spend more money. We just need to spend smarter. By trimming low-impact offerings and amplifying the ones employees actually use, we maximize ROI and employee satisfaction simultaneously."*

Transition:
"Now, reallocating resources is powerful — but we can go a step further. Instead of just funding the best programs overall, we can match the right benefits to the right people."

Slide 18 – Personalization (High Priority) (≈1.5 min)

*"That brings us to our second high-priority recommendation: personalization.

Our segmentation analysis revealed six distinct employee groups, each with very different priorities. For example, tech-savvy millennials in finance care about career growth and flexibility, while established boomers in HR prioritize stability and healthcare. Senior leadership has its own set of needs entirely.

Right now, TechLance takes more of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach, which risks disengagement. By tailoring benefits to these segments — such as offering tuition reimbursement to early-career employees, or expanded retirement matching to later-career staff — we send a clear signal: the company understands and supports its people.

This doesn’t just increase usage, it builds loyalty. Employees feel valued when benefits reflect their actual lives. And that translates into higher engagement, stronger satisfaction, and reduced turnover."*

Transition:
"So, personalization makes benefits more relevant. But while we improve alignment, we also have an opportunity to make the overall program more cost-efficient."

Slide 19 – Cost Efficiency (Medium Priority) (≈1.5 min)

*"Our third recommendation is focused on cost efficiency.

Because TechLance has a workforce of 5,000, we have real bargaining power with vendors. High-usage benefits like healthcare plans and communications platforms give us leverage to renegotiate contracts.

A 5 to 10 percent cost reduction is realistic here. On a $12 million annual budget, that equates to $600,000 to $1.2 million in potential savings — without cutting programs that employees value.

This is why we classify it as medium priority: negotiations take time. But the payoff is significant — cost savings that can be reinvested in high-impact programs, or simply kept as company savings, all while preserving employee satisfaction."*

Transition:
"So far, we’ve looked at reallocating funds, personalizing benefits, and reducing costs. But there’s one more lever that doesn’t require budget changes at all — and that’s increasing awareness of the benefits employees already have."

Slide 20 – Usage Enhancement (Medium Priority) (≈1.5 min)

*"Our final recommendation is usage enhancement.

Some of the most valuable programs are underutilized simply because employees don’t know enough about them. Take the premium health discount, for example. It delivers 89% satisfaction, but fewer than half of employees are even aware it exists. Or the 401k maximum matching program — it offers employees nearly $1,000 annually, but participation lags far behind its potential.

This is not a funding issue — it’s a communication issue. With targeted campaigns, educational sessions, and timely reminders, we can significantly increase participation. The result? Higher ROI, because fixed-cost benefits generate more value as usage rises. And importantly, employees feel more supported, knowing the company has made valuable resources clear and accessible to them.

In short, this is about shining a light on hidden gems already in the portfolio and ensuring employees can actually take advantage of them."*

Slide 13: Recommendations

High Priority

Slide 14: Portfoilio Rebalancing
  #include a visualization (maybe of current spend vs optimized spend)#
  Pitch: by analyzing usage data, we identified 566,516 tied up in underperforming benefits (include visual of where you got this number). Rebalancing the portfolio will mean we reallocate those funds to programs employees
  actually use and value, addressing the concern of satisfaction and retention without increasing overall costs. TechLance's overall ROI of benefits would also show improvement.
  #provide example: oh if funds were focused here instead of here....#
  we can pilot reallocation in one direction and set up quarterly / yearly benefits usage reviews for continuous optimization
  mention timeline

Slide 15: Personalization
  #include a visualization (of clustering groups) or example of a cluster and its data)
  Pitch: Another high priority recommendation is personalization. To push away the benefits being a one-size fits all program, we segment employees into key groups determined by factors like age, tenure, and department.
  This way we can tailor specific benefits recommendations and meet the employees' unique needs while maximizing usage. this will further drive higher satisfaction, retention, and smarter spending. #briefly explain / show 
  how based on a cluster we would choose what benefit#?
mention timeline, during this time, we can track usage and satisfaction KPIs before rolling it out to the entire company?

Slide 16: Cost Efficiency
  Pitch: Instead of cutting benefits do use, we can make them more cost-efficient. By using usage and satisfaction data, we can target our top-performing benfits for vendor negotiations. This could deliver a potential 5-15% reduction, unlocking more funds to reinvest into other high-impact areas while minimizing value reduction to employees.
  #maybeeee a visualization of the top few performing benefits overall?#

Slide 17: Usage Enhancement
  Pitch: some of the most valuable benefits are underutilized, meaning TechLance is paying value that employees are not seeing. By launching awareness campaigns, either through emails, workshops, or briefings, there is room for even 20-30% higher usage of these underutilized programs. Once again, this would mean stronger ROI benefits since employee satisfaction is greater and benefiting from currently funded programs.
This is easy to have as an ongoing project, checking in quarterly to see improvements
#include visualization of underused but high impact benefits#

The model begins with cleaned employee–benefit data, including usage frequency, satisfaction scores, and the number of employees using each benefit. We then apply both the current and the newly proposed budget allocations, ensuring the percentages remain balanced at 100%. For each benefit, the model calculates key metrics: utilization (average employee usage), satisfaction (employee sentiment), and cost per employee (budget divided by employee count). Using these values, we estimate a return-on-investment score, which is proportional to utilization multiplied by satisfaction, divided by cost per employee. This framework allows us to directly compare how reallocating the budget changes overall efficiency and the value employees receive from each benefit.
